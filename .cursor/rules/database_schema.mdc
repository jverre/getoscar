# Database Schema Documentation

[IMPORTANT: This documentation must be updated whenever database schema changes are made. All schema modifications should be reflected here to maintain accuracy.]

## Tables Overview

### auth.users (Managed by Supabase)
- Referenced only, not managed by Drizzle
- Contains core user authentication data
- Referenced by profiles and team_members

### profiles
- Extends Supabase auth.users
- 1:1 relationship with auth.users
- Primary purpose: Store additional user information
```sql
{
  id: uuid (PK, references auth.users),
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

### teams
- Represents collaborative groups
- Many-to-many relationship with users through team_members
```sql
{
  id: uuid (PK),
  name: string,
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

### team_members
- Junction table for users-teams relationship
- Enables many-to-many relationship
```sql
{
  id: uuid (PK),
  team_id: uuid (FK -> teams),
  user_id: uuid (FK -> auth.users),
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

### conversations
- Always belongs to a team
- Contains multiple messages
```sql
{
  id: uuid (PK),
  team_id: uuid (FK -> teams),
  title: string,
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp
}
```

### messages
- Part of a conversation
- Supports streaming responses
- Follows Vercel AI SDK conventions
```sql
{
  id: uuid (PK),
  conversationId: uuid (FK -> conversations),
  role: enum ('user' | 'assistant'),
  content: text,
  streaming: boolean,
  complete: boolean,
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

## Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### profiles
- SELECT: Viewable by all authenticated users
- UPDATE: Users can only update their own profile

### teams
- SELECT: Users can only view teams they belong to
- INSERT: Any authenticated user can create teams

### team_members
- SELECT: Users can view members of their teams
- INSERT: Users can join teams (user_id must match auth.uid)

### conversations
- SELECT: Users can view conversations in their teams
- INSERT: Users can create conversations in their teams

### messages
- SELECT: Users can view messages in their team conversations
- INSERT: Users can create messages in their team conversations

## Database Conventions

### Primary Keys
- All tables use UUIDs for primary keys
- Generated using defaultRandom()
- Consistent with Supabase auth.users

### Timestamps
- created_at: Present on all tables
- updated_at: Only on conversations (tracks last activity)
- All timestamps default to NOW()
- All timestamps are NOT NULL

### Foreign Keys
- All foreign keys are NOT NULL
- Named consistently: entityId (e.g., team_id, user_id)
- All have referential integrity constraints

### Enums
- message_role: ['user', 'assistant']
- Extensible for future message types
